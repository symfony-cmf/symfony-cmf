 * Translate between urls and node ids.

 *
 * URLs always start with a / even though they might be prefixed in the routing,
 * to separate different menues, or language versions, ...
 *
 * Please not that the mapper may use generic rules to translate between the two
 * and does not necessarily validate if the element identified by the url really
 * exists.
