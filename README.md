# This repository is no longer maintained

Due to lack of interest, we had to decide to discontinue this repository. 
The CMF project focusses on the [Routing component](https://github.com/symfony-cmf/routing) and [RoutingBundle](https://github.com/symfony-cmf/routing-bundle), which are still in active use by other projects.

This repository will no longer be upgraded and marked as abandoned, but will be kept available for legacy projects or if somebody wants to experiment with the CMF.

You can contact us in the #symfony_cmf channel of the [Symfony devs slack](https://symfony.com/slack).

Note the main purpose of this repository is to offer a composer package that ties together various packages that will be used in most CMF projects. The bulk of the development is done in other repositories on the https://github.com/symfony-cmf organization.

The Symfony CMF project makes it easier for **developers** to add **CMS functionality** to applications built with the **Symfony PHP** framework. Key development principles for the provided **set of bundles** are **scalability**, **usability**, **documentation** and **testing**.
